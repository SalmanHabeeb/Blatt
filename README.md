[Blatt](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SalmanHabeeb/Blatt) is a computer vision [application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SalmanHabeeb/Blatt) to detect plant disease

## Background

Plant diseases have historically caused famines, sometimes killing millions of people. In recent days, due to improvements in pesticides, the spread of diseases can be controlled.

However, pesticides are not required in many cases, especially in garden plants. Early detection and treatment of such diseases is sufficient many times.

In this project I use deep learning [application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SalmanHabeeb/Blatt) to detect plant disease from leaf images. This is a significant improvement over manual detection. The [application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SalmanHabeeb/Blatt) can detect several diseases in few seconds, and is convenient to use.

## App

The app is deployed at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/SalmanHabeeb/Blatt
